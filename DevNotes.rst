#1
lbnl-scienceit  (one dash)
is currently the current repo serving the pages that power the web site
https://github.com/lbnl-scienceit/smelly/settings/pages => 
https://smelly.lbl.gov

#2
But in a group meeting, agreed to move to a unified account under 
lbnl-science-it (two dashes)
so a fork was created: 
https://github.com/lbnl-science-it/smelly/settings/pages => https://lbnl-science-it.github.io/smelly/

eventually will make #2 the master
but will need to sync up with LBLnet/CPP to move the cloudflare config.
But any future reference will use #2,
eg work with IPO office.
